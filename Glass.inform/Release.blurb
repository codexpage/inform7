Lucinda and Theodora have the ends of the same couch, and they are taking turns seeing who can bend lowest and show off the most cleavage; while the old lady, in her wing chair, carries on about nonsense...<br/>Glass is a conversation-oriented fairy tale, taking place in one room. It was written to demonstrate one approach to handling conversation in Inform 7.<br/>Features a variety of additional verbs, non-player characters with an agenda, and narrative with multiple endings."
