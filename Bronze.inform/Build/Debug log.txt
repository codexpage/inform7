Problem PM_TableNotContinuation issued from inform7/Chapter 25/Tables.w, line 426

  >--> It looks as if 'Table of Common Color Values (continued)' (/Users/ywx/Library/Inform/Extensions/jon
    ingold/flexible windows.i7x, line 546) is meant to be related to an
    existing table, but I can't find one if it is. Perhaps you've put the new
    part before the original? The original has to be earlier in the source
    text.

nto[0] = -1, otn[0] = 1
nto[1] = 0, otn[1] = 2
nto[2] = 1, otn[2] = -1
Problem PM_TableContinuationAddsCols issued from inform7/Chapter 25/Tables.w, line 706

 In Part 5 - Fancy Screen Effects, Section 1 - Improved Status Line:


  >--> The table 'Table of User Styles (continued)' (source text, line 3305)
    won't work as a continuation, because it contains a column not found in the
    original 'Table of User Styles' (/Applications/Inform.app/Contents/Resources/Internal/Extensions/emily
    short/glulx text effects.i7x, line 30).


    The old table has columns: style name, background color, color, first line
    indentation, fixed width, font weight, indentation, italic, justification,
    relative size, reversed.


    The new table has columns: window, style name, background color.
