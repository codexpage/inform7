He puts his hand to the back of Lucinda's ankle, and draws it away again. 'Mother of God,' he says. He passes a hand over his lips, looking as though he is going to vomit; stands up in one abrupt movement. Lucinda's eyes follow him but she does not even try to stand.</span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote">'What did you hope to gain?' he asks, turning back. 'Don't you think I would have realized sooner or later?'</span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote">'But you might have realized too late,' Lucinda says, closing her eyes, pallid.

'I thought you friends.'</span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote">The old lady's jaw clenches, and you see a hint of the steel in her. Her closeness to the royal household has been life's blood to her these twenty years, and now she sees it end; she could explain, but does not choose that particular betrayal. 'Check the rest of your maidens,' she says. 'Good luck finding your bride. You will not discover her in this house.'</span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote">'Thank Providence for that,' he says, snatching up the glass slipper. </span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote">You watch him go, and think of the third daughter, waiting, in her bedroom, with the door locked.</span>&quot;;</p><p class="indent1">end the story saying &quot;<span class="quote">The Prince departs in anger</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">When Lucinda Endgame ends in Lucinda Marriage: </p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">The Prince gives a great sigh and puts his head down on Lucinda's lap.
