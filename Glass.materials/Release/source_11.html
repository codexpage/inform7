This bit of conversation might conventionally have gone before the banner in a When play begins... passage; but since we have no room descriptions in this game, this would mean having a banner immediately followed by a command prompt. So I decided instead to go with a null prologue and put this bit of  chat after the banner but before the command prompt.</span></p>
