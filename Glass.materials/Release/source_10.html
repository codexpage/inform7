<p class="indent0"><span class="heading">Chapter 3 - The World</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="comment">[Because most of what goes on here is conversation rather than interaction with objects, our setting is quite simple and most of it consists of the characters:]</span></p><p class="indent0">Stage is a room.  </p><p class="indent0">The old lady is a woman in the Stage. Understand &quot;<span class="quote">mother</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">stepmother</span>&quot; as the old lady.  The old lady is active. The description of the lady is &quot;<span class="quote">She looks plucked: thin neck with folds of skin exposed, nose beaky, lips white. Perhaps when her fortunes are mended her cosmetics too will improve.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The Prince is a man in the Stage. The description of the prince is &quot;<span class="quote">He's tolerably attractive, in his flightless way. It's hard not to pity him a little.</span>&quot; The prince carries a glass slipper. The glass slipper is wearable. Understand &quot;<span class="quote">shoe</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">heel</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">toe</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">foot</span>&quot; as the slipper. The description of the slipper is &quot;<span class="quote">It is very small for an adult woman's foot.</span>&quot; </p><p class="indent0">Lucy and Theodora are women in the Stage. The printed name of Lucy is &quot;<span class="quote">Lucinda</span>&quot;. Understand &quot;<span class="quote">Lucinda</span>&quot; as Lucy. Understand &quot;<span class="quote">Theo</span>&quot; as Theodora.<a name="note1ref"></a><span class="notecue"><a href="#note1">[1]</a></span>  The description of Theodora is &quot;<span class="quote">Soft, round, in every sense yielding: she eats too many candied almonds herself, but never grudges sharing them. No character worth mentioning.</span>&quot; The description of Lucy is &quot;<span class="quote">More compact than Theodora, and with more self-control.</span>&quot; </p><p class="indent0">The sofa is scenery in the stage. It is an enterable supporter. The description is &quot;<span class="quote">They never let you stand on it.</span>&quot; Some pillows are on the sofa. Understand &quot;<span class="quote">pillow</span>&quot; as the pillows. The description of the pillows is &quot;<span class="quote">Not as pretty as you.</span>&quot; The pillows are scenery.</p><p class="indent0">The wing chair is scenery in the stage. It is an enterable supporter. The description is &quot;<span class="quote">Pitiful wings, really.</span>&quot; Understand &quot;<span class="quote">wingchair</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">seat</span>&quot; as the chair.</p><p class="indent0">Instead of doing anything other than examining when the noun is a thing and the noun is scenery: say &quot;<span class="quote">That would not help matters, even if you could reach.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The perch is in the stage. It is scenery. The description is &quot;<span class="quote">It's adequately comfortable for your purposes.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Instead of doing something other than examining to the slipper: say &quot;<span class="quote">It's not yours.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Before wearing the slipper: say &quot;<span class="quote">There is no part of your body on which that slipper would fit.</span>&quot; instead.</p>
