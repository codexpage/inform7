This gets a little complicated because we have a lot of existing behavior to override. </span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="comment">The default behavior of the library allows the player to ASK any person ABOUT a subject; we don't want the player to be able to specify one person to talk to, since that would cause needless complexity. Anything he says should be heard by the whole group. We also are just allowing the player to speak keywords, so we don't want to distinguish between ASK and TELL, another feature of the standard library. </span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="comment">So we need to replace both ASK SOMEONE ABOUT SOMETHING and TELL SOMEONE ABOUT SOMETHING with one standard action that directs the player's speech to the whole group. We'll call this Mentioning.]</span></p>
