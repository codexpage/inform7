'I would have thought, as long as I have known your family, I would have--'</span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote">'She likes to keep to herself. Except, of course, when she surprises us all, and goes out. Come in, Cinderella,' says the lady. Lucinda squirms on the sofa.</span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote">And in she walks, looking a little as though she has just been woken. The color rises in her cheeks when she looks at the Prince.</span>&quot;. </p><p class="indent0">Checking Cinderella ends in disaster when the current subject is magic.</p><p class="indent0">Checking Cinderella ends in peace when the time since Checking Cinderella began is 4 minutes and the current subject is not magic.</p><p class="indent0">When Checking Cinderella ends in peace:</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">The Prince frowns at Cinderella a little longer, then seems to reach some decision.</span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote"></span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote">'This business of the shoe is nonsense,' he remarks.

'In fact, I think--' He turns and hurls the slipper against the wall, where it splinters into dozens of sparkling pieces. There is a great sigh in the room, and the old lady actually laughs.</span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote">The Prince's gaze lingers on Cinderella. She looks back at him, her chin tilted up. 'There are things my father need not know. Though I also would not lie to him about anything that I knew for certain.'</span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote">'A commendable attitude,' says the old lady briskly. 'And now I am having a brandy.

'You could have broken it. Lied to me. Remained hidden.' His jaw works. 'Didn't you understand that--'</span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote">'She understands,' says the old lady, rising from her chair. 'I told her. We all told her. She hoped that you would understand her secret but have the wit not to put her to the test.' Her fingers dig into the chairback. 'I'm afraid the rest of us -- not being in love with you, you see -- we had less faith in your intuition. We thought perhaps we might distract you with one of the other two. One of the plainly... non-magical ones.'</span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote">The Prince swallows. He is crying: not very man-like. 'You see I cannot conceal this; it would be treason, now I have seen this witchcraft with my own eyes...'</span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote">Cinderella backs away. 'I have no truck with devils,' she says. 'I was gifted or cursed in my nature, that is all. I cannot make it go away -- the power remains with me.'</span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote">'It's true,' says Lucinda. 'We poured holy water on her every day for a year.'</span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote">'But the law,' says the Prince.</span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote">'You're an idiot,' says the old lady.
