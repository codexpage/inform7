Each response is removed from the table after use, to prevent any repetition; if we want that move to provide interesting dialogue even if it is repeated exactly, we provide several entries for it (see the king's health to heirs move, below, which has two responses). The first one will be used the first time that move occurs; the second the second time; and so on.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="comment">&quot;blank&quot; is a stand-in subject, a kind of wild-card that will match anything.

<tr><td>king's health</td><td>heirs</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">'It's so fortunate,' says the old lady. 'That you're of an age -- that is, that the King has been so blessed with an heir who can follow in his footsteps when the time comes, which we all hope will be--' </span></p><span class="quote">Realizing she has led herself into a diplomatic difficulty, she sighs. 'God has truly blessed our little kingdom.'</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>king's health</td><td>heirs</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">'When the time comes, which will be when God wills it, you will be a fine King,' says the old lady firmly.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>blank</td><td>king's health</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">'I think the king is less concerned than the rest of us are,' says the Prince. 'But he has always been very brave, and philosophical. I believe he would meet death with a Socratic--' </span></p><span class="quote">Seeing that he has left behind his entire audience, including the old lady, he changes tack. '--with true Christian fortitude.'</span></p><span class="quote">There is a collective sigh of relief at a pious thought so comprehensibly expressed.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>blank</td><td>king's health</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">'I know very well how hard it will be to emulate my father's command,' says the Prince. 'He has a knowledge of how to speak to people which I do not.' </span></p><span class="quote">'Pssht,' says the old lady. You notice she does not actually contradict him.</span>&quot; </td></tr>
<tr><td>blank</td><td>king's health</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">'May he live long,' says Lucinda softly.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>blank</td><td>king's health</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">'You must try not to worry too desperately,' Lucinda says to the Prince in a comforting tone. 'I have heard only the best things about the doctors.' </span></p><span class="quote">'We would hardly have sent for a doctor with any but the best reputation,' says the Prince, with a half-smile. 'But doctors are human, and fallible.'</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>heirs</td><td>king's health</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">'It would have been better for us all if I had siblings,' says the Prince. 'My father feels it, I know.'</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>heirs</td><td>marriage</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">'Now I have heard a rumor,' says the old lady, pretending that this conversation topic just now occurred to her, rather than being the object of her determined pursuit for the last half hour. 'A rumor that you yourself were planning to wed, in the very near future.' </span></p><span class="quote">Theodora leans closer to the Prince, who tucks his hands more protectively around the slipper. </span></p><span class="quote">'There are a great many rumors,' he says.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>heirs</td><td>marriage</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">'I think I am not expressing a unique opinion,' says the old lady, brushing at her skirt with her gloves, 'when I say that the whole kingdom will be delighted to see your family increase yet further.'</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>marriage</td><td>ball</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">'It's true, you know, that my father threw the ball in the hope that I would-- that is, that it would lead to a greater acquaintance--' The Prince stops again, rattled, and glares down at the small shoe cradled in his hands. 'I had not been very attentive to ladies in my youth.' </span></p><span class="quote">The old lady looks very strange at that remark. 'Well-- my dear boy--' she begins. 'I am glad you feel comfortable-- that is, I will not mention-- if you feel you prefer--'</span></p><span class="quote">He blinks thick girlish lashes, and you see why she is worried. 'No, I didn't mean that I have a preference for boys, madam,' he remarks, more at his ease now that she is uncomfortable. 'Only that I have been very much occupied with other concerns, and not...'</span></p><span class="quote">He gestures. The shoe almost slips off its pillow. He catches it just in time.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>blank</td><td>love</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">A look of unexpected sweetness crosses the face of the Prince. The old lady watches this with interest.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>blank</td><td>shoe</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">[</span><span class="substitution">if not mentioning shoe</span><span class="quote">]'I'm sure it's nothing surprising,' remarks the old lady, 'if you didn't meet anyone at the ball that you felt immediately you could marry. Such short acquaintances... there's much more to an alliance than that. One must feel at ease with the family, for instance.' </span></p><span class="quote">The Prince opens his mouth, then closes it again. 'I did meet someone,' he admits. 'But I know nothing of her family. It hardly matters to me, however. [</span><span class="substitution">otherwise</span><span class="quote">]The Prince gives you an odd, almost grateful look. 'In fact I have chosen a wife,' he says. 'At the ball my father gave. [</span><span class="substitution">end if</span><span class="quote">]It will be the woman who can wear this shoe.' </span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>blank</td><td>ball</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">The Prince sighs. 'Yes,' he says. 'The ball, I meant to tell you...' </span></p><span class="quote">He stops.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>marriage</td><td>Theo</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">Theodora blushes with sudden consciousness. The Prince glances at her piercingly. </span></p><span class="quote">'Out of the mouths of birds,' remarks the old lady, smiling.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>marriage</td><td>birds</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">'Do you suppose it means that marriage is for the birds?' asks Lucinda. </span></p><span class="quote">'It has a certain Delphic inscrutability,' says the Prince, grinning at her.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>blank</td><td>birds</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">'I suppose it wishes to advocate a greater interest in aviary concerns?' the Prince asks, looking at you with curiosity. </span></p><span class="quote">'I wouldn't credit it with nearly that much intelligence,' says the old lady. Witch.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>Theo</td><td>heirs</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">'Ah, Theodora... I'm so fortunate in my own children,' the old lady goes on. 'You can never understand what a great pleasure there is in them until you have your own.' </span></p><span class="quote">'Indeed, so I have heard,' the Prince says.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>God</td><td>Lucinda</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">'Lucinda is thinking about becoming a nun,' says Theodora. </span></p><span class="quote">Lucinda gives Theodora a look of passionate dislike. 'That was when I was younger,' she says.</span></p><span class="quote">The Prince raises his eyebrows. 'Surely a serious vocation could manifest itself even in a child?' he says. 'I would not be too quick to reject the possibility, if--' </span></p><span class="quote">Lucinda is leaning forward at him again. </span></p><span class="quote">'--if you think it is what you were meant for,' he finishes weakly. 'Then again, it might have been a childish whim.'</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>blank</td><td>heirs</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">'How sad that your dear mother did not live along enough to give you siblings,' says the old lady, dabbing the edge of her eye with one finger. </span></p><span class="quote">'You probably don't remember your mother -- such a sweet woman -- a wonderful friend to me at that time.' She sighs. 'I know I talk so much nonsense to you, Prince, but it is for her sake. I cannot help thinking that she would have wanted me to take a little concern for you.'</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>love</td><td>marriage</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">'It is a pity,' says the old lady. 'But love and marriage often have so little to do with one another, at the upper levels of society. And certainly when matters of state intervene.' </span></p><span class="quote">'So my father reminds me,' says the Prince. 'He considers me a romantic and says I have been reading too much Byron.'</span></p><span class="quote">'And have you?' asks the old lady curiously.</span></p><span class="quote">'I cannot abide Byron and am devoted to Sir Philip Sidney, and the difference between my father and me is that I have paid enough attention to have a taste in these matters.' He smiles briefly. 'So you see he loses the battle and wins the war.'</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>blank</td><td>love</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">'I think the feelings at the outset of a marriage are nearly irrelevant,' says Lucinda. 'If there is commitment and good intention, then you can learn to live with the person, and if there isn't... no amount of affection, or, or...' </span></p><span class="quote">'Physical attraction, is what my sister means to say,' Theodora cuts in.</span></p><span class="quote">'Or that, yes-- none of those things will count.'</span></p><span class="quote">Theodora makes a face. 'I bet they count a bit more than you want to admit.'</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>blank</td><td>stepmother</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">The old lady glares at you.</span>&quot;</td></tr>

The old lady frowns, suggesting very rapid and dangerous thought. Theodora lies back against the pillows, interested in the story and too stupid to realize it has to do with her.
