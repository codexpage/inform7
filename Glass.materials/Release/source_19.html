<tr><td>ball</td><td>shoe</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">'Midnight,' repeats the old lady. 'Well, well.' She smiles at the Prince. 'Good luck to you. It was quick thinking taking the shoe.' </span></p><span class="quote">He blushes. 'She left it on the stairs; I thought it was the only thing I was going to have left of her.'</span></p><span class="quote">'Mm. Love.' She smiles at him. 'I do wish your mother were alive.'</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>shoe</td><td>ball</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">'That was a good ball,' says Theodora, out of nowhere. 'It was the nicest ball I've ever been to.' </span></p><span class="quote">The Prince chuckles. 'Me too,' he says. 'Oddly.'</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>blank</td><td>stepmother</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">The old lady starts. 'That is a good point,' she says. 'For a bird. Are you intending to interview the older ladies as well? Oh, I don't mean myself, of course!' She manages an almost natural laugh. 'But how do you know that your intended is a young lady?' </span></p><span class="quote">The prince looks thunderstruck.</span></p><span class="quote">'She might be anyone -- my friend Lady Carpwell for instance--'</span></p><span class="quote">'I'm sure she was a young woman,' he says firmly, gathering strength again. 'There were references in her conversation that -- things she said which --'</span></p><span class="quote">'Naturally, if truthful.'</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>blank</td><td>Theo</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">[</span><span class="substitution">if mentioning Theodora</span><span class="quote">]Theodora blushes. 'Stupid bird,' she says. </span></p><span class="quote">'Must start somewhere,' says the Prince, shrugging. [</span><span class="substitution">otherwise</span><span class="quote">]Theodora leans closer to the Prince. [</span><span class="substitution">end if</span><span class="quote">]'I can go first, if you want,' she says. Without any shyness, she lifts her skirt slightly and slips her feet out of her afternoon slippers, wiggling her feet on the soft carpet.</span></p><span class="quote">'So strange,' she says, giggling. 'Taking off my shoes in the presence of a man!'</span></p><span class="quote">'I won't tell anyone,' the Prince assures her. </span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>blank</td><td>Lucinda</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">[</span><span class="substitution">if mentioning Lucinda</span><span class="quote">]'Might as well start there as anywhere,' says the Prince, shrugging. [</span><span class="substitution">otherwise</span><span class="quote">]The Prince licks his lips. [</span><span class="substitution">end if</span><span class="quote">]'Miss Lucinda, would you mind trying the slipper? You needn't -- that is, please do not regard this in the nature of a royal request, if you would rather not.' </span></p><span class="quote">The old lady catches Lucinda's eye, and jerks her head slightly: a command.</span></p><span class="quote">'It would be a pleasure,' Lucinda says, though her eyes cloud a little as the Prince kneels at her feet and begins to untie the laces of her boot. Theodora watches the proceedings curiously. </span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>ball</td><td>magic</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">[</span><span class="substitution">if mentioning magic</span><span class="quote">]The Prince's eye goes to you. 'Your bird, madam, is freakishly percipient. Positively unnatural.' </span></p><span class="quote">'Yes,' she says. 'Though I promise you it arrived in that condition and was not made so by anyone in this house.' She sighs. [</span><span class="substitution">end if</span><span class="quote">]'You are in a difficult situation,' says the old lady. 'You are too intelligent not to have considered the problem thoroughly, and all the risks involved in choosing someone under those circumstances.'</span></p><span class="quote">Lucinda's lips tighten. 'Magic is abhorrent to God,' she says.</span></p><span class="quote">'That is certainly the opinion of some,' the old lady agrees. 'I myself wonder whether He would have encompassed in His creation any power which He considered wholly evil. But that is a private philosophy, and does not excuse a violation of the law.' She glances at the Prince. 'Forgive me: I stray from your problem.'</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>magic</td><td>shoe</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">'Perhaps the shoe itself is--' begins Theo thoughtfully. </span></p><span class="quote">Lucinda scoots a little way from the pillow.</span></p><span class="quote">'It hasn't done anything magical,' comments the prince, frowning at the slipper in his hands.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>magic</td><td>birds</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">All eyes turn to you. 'I have heard,' the Prince says tentatively, 'about creatures who are possessed...' </span></p><span class="quote">The old lady makes a face. 'But what demon would desire to possess a household bird?'</span></p><span class="quote">The Prince frowns, as though he feels the logic is flawed but can't quite find the point of his objection.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>blank</td><td>magic</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">'The creature gets redundant,' says the old lady. 'I'm afraid it has a taste for melodrama.'</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>magic</td><td>ball</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">'I have considered the problem,' says the Prince. 'Very closely. I have not been able to sleep for considering it.' </span></p><span class="quote">'Do you know,' asks the old lady, 'why she...?'</span></p><span class="quote">The Prince shakes his head. 'Until she fled I had no hint that she was not simply as she appeared.'</span></p><span class="quote">'Extraordinarily beautiful, no doubt,' remarks the old lady, with a hint of a curling smile; and Lucinda titters.</span></p><span class="quote">'And kind, and wise,' the Prince replies, refusing to be drawn. 'Do you know whether magic can counterfeit those qualities as well?'</span></p><span class="quote">'Wisdom rarely and kindness never at all,' says the old lady.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>ball</td><td>marriage</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">'Maybe,' Lucinda suggests, 'she thought it would be wrong to deceive you about what she was, and chose this way to, to make it known.' </span></p><span class="quote">A spark of comprehension comes into Theo's eyes. 'Yes,' she says. 'She might have thought that-- I mean, I can imagine...'</span></p><span class="quote">The old lady glares at her. The Prince looks back and forth, confused.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>blank</td><td>marriage</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">'It seems to me,' says the old lady, after a long thoughtful moment, 'that you have no choice but to try this shoe on every eligible young woman, and determine who she was. And if I were you, I would also invent an explanation for this extraordinary method of bride-selection that will satisfy the people at large.' </span></p><span class="quote">He chuckles, but nods.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>marriage</td><td>shoe</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">'Yes, the shoe,' says Lucinda to you; and to her mother: 'Do you think we could send it back to bird school?' </span></p><span class="quote">'It knows far too much already and requires no further education,' snaps the old lady.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>blank</td><td>love</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">'Are you sure that it wasn't just an infatuation?' the old lady asks gently. 'Such a short acquaintance-- forgive me, but you've always seemed so level-headed.' </span></p><span class="quote">The Prince smiles without humor. 'I would have said the same. But after meeting her, I am... very sure. It's strange that this is possible, I know.'</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>blank</td><td>magic</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">'Do you agree with your father's views?' asks Theodora. 'On magic, I mean.' </span></p><span class="quote">'I have not had an opportunity to study his reasoning,' says the Prince, stiffly. 'And in any case it is not for me to challenge his laws.'</span>&quot;</td></tr>
